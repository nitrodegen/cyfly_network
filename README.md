# cyfly Network


cyfly Network is a peer-to-peer web browsing protocol.
<br>it is created so that there is no need for servers anymore.<br>
On this network, there is no client-server communication (in terms of web browsing)<vr>
Peers are actually hosting the website (files).<br>
Only the creator can change the code of the website, using his private key,no one else.<br>

<h1>How to use it?</h1>
this network is currently not up. but if i see somebody actually interested in it, might start it.<br>
but of course, you can do that as well. no fuss.<br>

<h1>example #1 (uploading the website to our network) </h1>

<h1>example #2 (accessing uploaded website) </h1>
<p>you are actually accessing your daemon server on your computer using port 3283.<br>then you are just asking for domain of the website and path.</p>
